# dbfold
 A Python library to analyze equilibrium and unfolding simulations to  compute protein folding rates from detailed balance
Authors: Amir Bitran, William M. Jacobs, Eugene Shakhnovich

Detailed instructions are provided in the IPython Notebook, dbfold_test.ipynb. 
If the MCPU package is used for simulation, a separate readme is provided within the
MCPU directory.

In case one desires to update folding rates given new data, the notebook
update_folding_rates_text.ipynb provides instructions for how to do this, but this should
be done after initial calculation of folding rates (as explained in 
dbfold_test.ipynb).
