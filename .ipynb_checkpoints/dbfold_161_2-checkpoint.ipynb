Upon obtaining a minimized PDB structure, we count its contacts (for use in setting up umbrella biasing) and identify substructures. It may be worth experimenting to find parameters that produce sensible substructures for a given protein. We will both visualize the substructures on a contact map, and also produce a .pml file, which contains a series of commands to visualize these substructures directly on the equlibrated structure in PYMOL.
